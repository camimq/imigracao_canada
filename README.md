# Canada Immigration

Project developed during the Data Visualization course, available on the [Alura Platform](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/data-visualization-graficos-bibliotecas-python). During the course, the instructor [ValquÃ­ria Alencar](https://github.com/vqrca) used a database that shows the evolution of migration from different countries to Canada. For the purpose of the course (understanding how to use Python libraries for data analysis and visualization), we only considered data from Brazil and Argentina.

## What was covered

    - Pandas
